For more information on the CIP classification, see the Classification of Instructional Programs, Canada 2016. This variant is different from the STEM variant used in the 2011 National Household Survey. For information on comparability between the two variants, refer to the Education Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2016, Catalogue no. 98-500-X2016013.",,,,
4,"The immigrant status variable refers to whether the person is a non-immigrant, an immigrant or a non-permanent resident.

8,"Visible minority refers to whether a person belongs to a visible minority group as defined by the Employment Equity Act and, if so, the visible minority group to which the person belongs. The Employment Equity Act defines visible minorities as ""persons, other than Aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour."" The visible minority population consists mainly of the following groups: South Asian, Chinese, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Arab, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Korean and Japanese.

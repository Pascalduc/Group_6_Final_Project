2019-08-01T04:00:00Z,"On August 1, 2019, the data for 2018 for “Total impaired driving” have been corrected.",,,,,
,,,,,,
Footnotes:,,,,,,
1,"For the period from 1998 to 2017 Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) data are not available for all respondents. In order to report this level of detail for police services still reporting to the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) over this time, a process of imputation was applied to derive counts for violations that do not exist on their own in the aggregate survey. For approximately 80% of the aggregate offence codes, there is a 1:1 mapping with a new incident-based violation code. For violations where this was not the case, such as the aggregate other Criminal Code category, it was necessary to estimate (impute) this figure using the distribution of other Criminal Code offences from existing Incident-based UCR2 respondents.",,,,,
2,"During the production of each year's crime statistics, data from the previous year are revised to reflect any updates or changes that have been received from the police services.",,,,,
3,"The methodology for calculating census metropolitan area (CMA) populations was modified in 2003. Starting in 1996, the populations for CMAs have been adjusted to reflect the actual policing boundaries within the CMA and do not reflect the official Statistics Canada population for these CMAs. CMA data are included within province-level data.",,,,,
4,"Police reported statistics may be affected by differences in the way police services deal with minor offences. In some instances, police or municipalities might chose to deal with some minor offences using municipal by-laws or provincial provisions rather than Criminal Code provisions. Counts are based on the most serious violation in the incident.",,,,,
5,"In January 2018, the Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) definitions of “founded” and “unfounded” criminal incidents were updated to reflect a more victim-centred approach for recording crimes that consider the complexities of certain offences such as sexual assault, family violence and intimate partner violence. Under the new reporting standards, specific offences may be more likely reported by police as founded rather than unfounded (or unsubstantiated), which would exclude them from police-reported crime rates and crime severity indices. Data for 2019 represent the first complete year of UCR data collected under the new reporting standards.  As a result, for selected violations and police services, the actual proportion of incidents in 2019 that were classified as “not cleared” has increased. Use caution when comparing these data with prior years.",,,,,
6,"A high crime rate or Crime Severity Index (CSI) may indicate that a municipality is a geographical area that provides commercial business, human or public services, or entertainment for many people who reside outside, as well as inside, the municipality. As a result, these municipalities may have large part-time or temporary populations which are excluded from both their population bases and their crime rate and CSI calculations.",,,,,
7,"With the release of 2012 data, revised population estimates at the respondent level were applied back to and including 2004. This resulted in boundary changes for the census metropolitan areas (CMA) of Saint John for 2005 to 2011 and for Winnipeg for 2011. Crime data for these years for these respondents have therefore been revised.",,,,,
8,"Population figures reflect only the permanent or resident population of a jurisdiction. Where a jurisdiction serves as the centre for commercial businesses, human or public services, or entertainment, it may have substantial “part-time” populations, e.g., tourists, cabin owners, commuters, students, and seasonal staff. These temporary populations, whose permanent residence is within another jurisdiction, are excluded from a jurisdiction’s population figures. This may be a factor to consider when examining the crime rate and Crime Severity Index for some municipalities.",,,,,
9,The census metropolitan area (CMA) of Ottawa-Gatineau was formerly known as Ottawa-Hull.,,,,,
10,"Ottawa numbers also include child pornography incidents reported by the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which is located in the City of Ottawa. The Centre responds to internet-facilitated sexual abuse cases nationally. Therefore, while the incidents are detected by the RCMP Centre located in Ottawa and appear in Ottawa's crime statistics, the incidents themselves or the offenders are not limited to the city of Ottawa.",,,,,
11,"The increase in failure to stop or remain in 2014 for Gatineau Police Service (24216) can be attributed to a change in charging practices within the police service. Rather than using provincial statutes, they are now charging these incidents based on Criminal Code provisions. Therefore, comparisons with previous years should not be made.",,,,,
12,"Prior to 2013, all incidents of child pornography recorded by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Service's Canadian Police Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (CPCMEC), located in Ottawa, were reported under the Ottawa Police Service. In 2014, Statistics Canada began reporting CPCMEC data separately and revised data for 2013 to account for this change. As a result of revisions to the 2013 data, some incidents identified by the CPCMEC and referred to the Ottawa Police Service for investigation may have been transferred to the CPCMEC. As such, the revised number of incidents for Ottawa Police Service for 2013 may be underrepresented and should not be compared to other years.",,,,,
13,"The violent crime category has been expanded under the Incident-based Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR2) to include a number of offences not previously included in the violent crime category, including uttering threats, criminal harassment and forcible confinement. Therefore, total violent crime counts in this table will not match total violent crime counts from the Aggregate Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (URC).",,,,,
14,"In 2011, the introduction of the Immediate Roadside Prohibition (IRP) in British Columbia provided an alternative method for officers to proceed with penalties for impaired drivers and may account for the trends reported for 2011 and 2012.",,,,,
15,"On June 21, 2018, Part 1 of Bill C-46 “An Act to amend the Criminal Code (relating to conveyances) and to make consequential amendments to other Acts” came into effect. Part 2 of this legislation came into effect on December 18, 2018. As a result of this legislation, the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Survey created 19 new violation codes and expired 15 existing traffic-specific violation codes.",,,,,
16,"On October 17, 2018, Bill C-45 “An Act respecting cannabis and to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the Criminal Code and other Acts” came into effect. As a result, all prior pre-legalization cannabis-related legislation under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA) has been expired and replaced with 22 new violation codes under the Cannabis Act.",,,,,
17,"In 2016, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) detachment in Montréal underwent an exercise in making corrective measures to address under-counting of incidents importation/exportation and trafficking of drug offences. In response, Statistics Canada applied estimates to the 2015 revised data. As a result, numbers and rates from 2015 onwards should not be compared to data prior to 2015.",,,,,
18,"On May 18, 2017, Bill C-37 ""An Act to amend the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and to make related amendments to other Acts"" came into effect. As a result, the offence of possessing, producing, selling or importing anything knowing it will be used to produce or traffic in crystal meth or ecstasy was expanded to include all substances listed in Schedule I, II , III, IV or V of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.",,,,,
19,"In 2011, the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act was amended to make it illegal for anyone to possess, produce, sell or import anything knowing it will be used to produce or traffic in crystal meth or ecstasy. The Uniform Crime Reporting Survey (UCR) introduced a new violation code to collect this information.",,,,,
20,Detailed information of this category is available upon request.,,,,,
21,"Abbotsford-Mission, British Columbia and Kingston, Ontario became new census metropolitan areas (CMAs) as of the 2001 Census. Moncton, New Brunswick, Peterborough, Ontario, Brantford, Ontario, Guelph, Ontario, Barrie, Ontario, and Kelowna, British Columbia became new CMAs as of the 2006 Census. Lethbridge, Alberta and Belleville, Ontario became new CMAs as of the 2016 Census.",,,,,
22,"In 2009, slight changes were made to the respondent-to-CMA mapping for this census metropolitan area (CMA) which have resulted in minor revisions to previously published data.",,,,,
23,"In 2018, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) reporting practices for drug seizures reported by Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) to the RCMP in Niagara were amended to better align with the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) survey in an effort to report consistent and accurate data. Due to this amendment in reporting practices, the RCMP detachment provided an estimate of the actual number of incidents for violations in 2017. Data should therefore be used with caution.",,,,,
24,"Previous to 2014, Greater Sudbury (35290) would record only those incidents where a search warrant was obtained and a charge related to child pornography was laid. As of 2014, reporting practices have changed to include all information of IP addresses with links to child pornography for information gathering and intelligence purposes. Therefore, comparisons with previous years should be made with caution.",,,,,

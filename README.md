## Machine Learning Model 

Our objective in this project is to predict Airbnb rental values using the features given in our dataset. We plan to do this by conducting a sentiment analysis using data about comments from `reviews2017.csv`, and feeding it to an NLP pipeline so that it can be used for machine learning, as well as taking variables from `listings2017.csv` to perform a multiple linear regression.
